        <img src=“images/earth.jpg" width="400" />
        <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and is the largest of the
          terrestrial planets. Unlike the other planets in the solar system that are named
          after classic deities the Earth’s name comes from the Anglo-Saxon word erda
          which means ground or soil. The Earth was formed approximately 4.54 billion
          years ago and is the only known planet to support life.</p>
